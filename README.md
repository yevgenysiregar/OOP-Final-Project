<p>Here's my  final project, I'm creating a Perfume Character Generator based on Name.

Brief Description : 
At the beginning of starting this project, this project will check if dataset.txt is exist or not. If dataset.txt is exist then application will load dataset, but if dataset.txt is not exist, then this application will create dataset.txt and application will ask user to give the score for every alphabet within range 1 â€“ 9.
After check dataset.txt, this application will check perfume database from perfume-theme.csv file. This file contains Perfume name, description, theme, and composition, separated by vertical pipe |. 
After preparation is complete, then application will ask user to input the name and the application will counting the name and pairing with the closest score with perfume.

<p>Essential Algorithm:
1.	Looping: this program uses for loop, while loop and forEach
2.	Control Flow: this program uses nested if else statement
3.	Dictionary: this program uses dictionary to keep history
4.	Class: This program uses class to make it easier to implement data
5.	Function/method: this program uses function/method to make it easier to write a code that are reusable
6.	Abstract : this program use abstract class and extend the class
7.	Interface : this programe have an interface
